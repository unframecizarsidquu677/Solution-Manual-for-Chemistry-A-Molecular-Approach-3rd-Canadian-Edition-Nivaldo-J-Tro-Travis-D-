  * This innovative, pedagogically driven text explains difficult concepts in a student-oriented manner. The book offers a rigorous and accessible treatment of general chemistry in the context of relevance. Chemistry is presented visually through multi-level images―macroscopic, molecular and symbolic representations―helping students see the connections among the formulas (symbolic), the world around them (macroscopic), and the atoms and molecules that make up the world (molecular).
